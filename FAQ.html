            <h3>How do I become a supplier?</h3>
                <p>Thanks for your interest in becoming one of our suppliers. However, we already have approved suppliers and contractors and are not accepting any new suppliers.</p>

        <div id="question">
            <h3>I’ve got a suggestion for a new product.</h3>
                <p>Every year, we get plenty of new product suggestions. To prevent any possible misunderstandings or infringements, we’ve had to adopt a strict policy of not accepting ideas from outside our Beta’s system. While we may be missing out on some great ideas, we’ve had to take this position.</p>

            <h3>Is there a chance for supporting charities, sports events or parties?</h3>

        <div id="question">
            <h3>What is the reason for rising the prices? </h3>
                <p>We are proud of serving the best food and meals across the field of quick service restaurants, not only in terms of the food’s quality and special taste, but also when it comes to the value. It is crucial to consider that the meals’ prices are related to a number of factors, like the inflation that affects the prices of the ingredients, rising costs of supplying, importing and distributing, in addition to the costs of preparation in the restaurants.</p>

        <div id="question">
            <h3>How can I contribute to your charity work?</h3>
                <p>You can contribute through our donation boxes in all of our branches or when you buy any Meal, where a part of the Meal’s sales goes to developing the educational process in the areas that need it the most.</p>

        <div id="question">
            <h3>What is the type of meat used in your meals?</h3>
                <p>We use 100% pure Halal meat in preparing Beta’s tasty meals. We use pieces of muscle meat from the rear quarter, the front quarter and part of the cattle’s thigh ONLY. We get the meat pieces from authorized suppliers, who follow Beta’s strict quality and food safety standards and the Halal practices.</p>

        <div id="question">
            <h3>What is the reason for not having The Open Door Tour in all branches?</h3>
                <p>Beta has always been a pioneer when it comes to transparent communication with customers. We are the first who opened the kitchens’ doors to customers to closely check the food safety procedures we follow. Branches and timings have been picked so that our customers could have their tour and make the most out of it, away from peak times and crowded restaurants, because it is hard to make the tour while preparing the meals. Timings are pre-planned to make sure the manager, responsible for the tour, is available.</p>
